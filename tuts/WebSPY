Description

WebSPY sends URLs sniffed from a client to your local Netscape browser for display, updated in real-time (as the target
surfs, your browser surfs along with them, automagically). Netscape must be running on your local X display ahead of time.

It  is an interesting tool from the dsniff family of tools including dsniff (password sniffer), arpspoof (ARP poisoning
tool), dnsspoof (DNS spoofing tool), msgsnarf (view messages from IM clients), mailsnarf (view email messages), tcpkill
(kill tcp connections on a local LAN), tcpnice (force other connections to “play nice” with their tcp connections) and
webspy (view a targets web browsing in real time). When properly setup it will intercept web browsing requests from the
victim and display them in the attackers web browser in real time. it places information at your fingertips, empowering
you to improve many aspects of your business. It saves network and system administrators time when reporting on web usage,
investigating bandwidth issues, Internet misuse, and other network problems.

Web Spy is a web reporting tool that automates the process of importing log data from over 200 common network devices,
transforming it into useful information, and securely delivering meaningful reports to the right person.

It also saves network and system administrators time when reporting on web usage, investigating bandwidth issues, Internet
misuse, and other network problems. Don’t trawl through log files. Generate a useful report with the key information you
need to know about.

Usage

Syntax

webspy [-i interface | -p pcapfile] host

Example

    cyborg@cyborg:~$ sudo webspy -i eth0  192.168.1.6
