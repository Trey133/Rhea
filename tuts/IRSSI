How do I configure irssi?

          I am using irssi client for IRC chat and I would like to know how to
          configure the ~/.irssi/config file so that I can put in my username
          and password (I have a registered Nick in the IRC). Also I'd like to
          know if I can configure it to open multiple terminals(as in
          gnome-terminal windows) to connect to different channels like #ubuntu
          , #ubuntu-in and so on. Or should I alias the command with different
up vote   parameters so as to connect to different channels from different
47 down   terminals.

               It is preferred if you can post separate questions instead of
               combining your questions into one. That way, it helps the people
               answering your question and also others hunting for atleast one
               of your questions. Thanks! – guntbert Dec 22 '15 at 17:56

                    You've asked a lot of questions in one, but I'll help you with as many of them
                    as I can.

                    First, you need to add your IRC server of choice - fire up irssi, and type the
                    following:

                    /server add -auto -network Freenode irc.freenode.net 6667

                    That will add the Freenode IRC network to your IRSSI config, and will
                    automatically connect when you run irssi.

                    /network add -nick <your-nick> Freenode

                    That will add your nick to the new Freenode network, and will automatically use
                    that nick whenever connecting to the network.

                    /channel add -auto #ubuntu Freenode

                    That will make you join #ubuntu on Freenode everytime you run irssi.

                    Assuming you have your nick registered, you can do this to identify
                    automatically:

                    /network add -autosendcmd "/msg nickserv identify password ;wait 2000" Freenode

                    You can switch between channels with Alt-2, Alt-3, etc, with each channel being
                    Alt-Number

                    If you're interested, here is my ~/.irrsi/config file:

                    servers = (
                      { address = "irc.ubuntu.com"; chatnet = "Ubuntu"; port = "8001"; },
                      #There is actually very little difference between irc.ubuntu.com
                      # and irc.freenode.net - irc.u.c is just a redirect
                      {
                        address = "irc.freenode.net";
                        chatnet = "Freenode";
                        port = "6667";
                        use_ssl = "no";
                        ssl_verify = "no";
                        autoconnect = "yes";
                      }
                    );
                    # I'm a freenode user all the way man
                    chatnets = {
                      Freenode = {
                        type = "IRC";
                        nick = "changeme";
                        autosendcmd = "/msg nickserv identify <password removed> ;wait 2000";
                      };
                    };

                    # Channels I hang out in a lot. Change these to your own.
                    channels = (
                      { name = "#2buntu"; chatnet = "Freenode"; autojoin = "yes"; },
                    );

                      "fe-text" = { actlist_sort = "refnum"; };
                    };

                    If you're someone who likes to add all sorts of cool functionality, then you
                    should take a look at the irssi scripts site - there are all sorts of little
                    gems there.

         If you start irssi in Ubuntu, it create a default configuration file
         in ~/.irssi/config already containing your data taken from system
         (nick and ident set to your username and realname to your Full Name).

         There is the connection to freenode network already setup, just write
         /connect Ubuntu, then /join #ubuntu, and repeat for other favorite
         channels.

         You can switch between channel with Alt-2, Alt-3, etc.

         You can change nick with /nick nitstorm once connected to server, or
         change globally, executing the command /set nick nitstorm, then /save
         to modify permanently your config file. The same way you can change
         real_name and user_name with /set.

up vote  You can add autojoin channels with
6 down
vote     /channel add -auto #ubuntu Ubuntu

         (see /help channel for help).

         You could also modify the config file by hand, but is better to
         execute commands to modify it inside irssi, then save the
         configuration.

         You terminate your sessione with /quit.
