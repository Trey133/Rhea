Red Box Plans
by The Jolly Roger
Red boxing is simulating the tones produced by public payphones when you drop your money in. The tones are beeps
of 2200Hz + 1700Hz a nickle is 1 beep for 66 milliseconds. A dime is 2 beeps, each 66 milliseconds with a 66
millisecond pause between beeps. A quarter is 5 beeps, each 33 milliseconds with a 33 millisecond pause between
beeps.
There are two commonly used methods being used by Phreaks to make free calls.
1.An electronic hand-held device that is made from a pair of Wien-bridge oscillators with the timing controlled by 555
timing chips.
2.A tape recording of the tones produced by a home computer. One of the best computers to use would be an Atari ST.
It is one of the easier computers to use because the red box tones can be produced in basic with only about 5
statements.
